                    <p>
                        <br>OttoTHON was founded by Jillian Lynch. Lynch brought the first event to Syracuse University in 2015. Since then, we have grown to raise 
                        well over a quarter million dollars for Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital making our mark within this national Dance Marathon movement!
                        All donations from OttoTHON 2019 are going to be used to help build the Golisano Center for Special Needs. This center will provide services 
                        to children with disabilities from all across the Upstate New York area. Some of these kids are on waitlists for 2+ years and this center 
                        will give them greater access to the resources they need.<br>
