                    <p>
                        This is to provide Syracuse University student organizations with a long-term service project that will enhance the quality of 
                        life for students, facult and staff living off-campus and aid in the beautification of the off-campuse community.
                        Students can participate in the Adopt-A-Street program at their convenience! You can contact Joe Personte at 
                        <a href = "mailto:jpersont@syr.edu" target="_blank">jpersont@syr.edu</a> if you or your group/club/organization is interested 
                        in participating. Adopt-A-Street is a great way to fulfill community service hours! OCCS will provide rubber gloves and trash bags

                    <p>
                        <br>OttoTHON was founded by Jillian Lynch. Lynch brought the first event to Syracuse University in 2015. Since then, we have grown to raise 
                        well over a quarter million dollars for Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital making our mark within this national Dance Marathon movement!
                        All donations from OttoTHON 2019 are going to be used to help build the Golisano Center for Special Needs. This center will provide services 
                        to children with disabilities from all across the Upstate New York area. Some of these kids are on waitlists for 2+ years and this center 
                        will give them greater access to the resources they need.<br>
